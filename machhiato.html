<div class="content">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 shot of espresso (18-20 grams of coffee)</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons of steamed milk (for a traditional macchiato)</li>
        <li>Optional: Sweetener (sugar or syrups) for added flavor</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind the coffee beans finely and brew a shot of espresso (about 30 ml).</li>
            <li>Steam a small amount of milk (1-2 teaspoons) until it's frothy, but not too much foam. Traditional macchiatos have a small amount of milk, just enough to "mark" the espresso.</li>
            <li>Pour the espresso into a small, pre-warmed cup.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, carefully add the steamed milk to the center of the espresso. The milk should form a small spot (or "mark") on the espresso, which gives the drink its name ("macchiato" means "stained" or "marked" in Italian).</li>
            <li>Optional: Add sweetener (sugar, vanilla syrup) if you prefer a sweeter taste. Stir gently if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your macchiato!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A traditional macchiato has very little milk, so if you prefer more milk, consider trying a **latte macchiato**, where the milk is the base, and the espresso is added on top.</li>
            <li>For a stronger coffee flavor, opt for a single shot of espresso. If you want a milder drink, use a double shot.</li>
            <li>To make a **caramel macchiato**, drizzle caramel syrup over the drink for added sweetness and flavor.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're using a milk frother, ensure you're only frothing a small amount of milk to keep it light and airy. The key to a perfect macchiato is the balance between the strong espresso and the small amount of milk.</p>
