    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water. For the best taste, use fresh water heated to just below boiling point (around 200°F or 93°C).</li>
            <li>Place 1-2 teaspoons of instant coffee into your coffee mug, depending on how strong you prefer your coffee.</li>
            <li>Once the water is ready, pour it into the mug over the instant coffee. Stir well until the coffee granules dissolve completely.</li>
            <li>If desired, add sugar or sweetener to taste and stir until fully dissolved. You can also add flavored syrups or spices like cinnamon or vanilla for an extra flavor boost.</li>
            <li>For creamier coffee, add milk or cream to your taste and stir to combine. You can use any type of milk or milk alternative (e.g., oat milk, almond milk).</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your quick and easy instant coffee!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use freshly boiled water, as it helps dissolve the coffee more effectively and creates a smoother taste.</li>
            <li>If you prefer your coffee stronger, you can adjust the amount of instant coffee to suit your taste.</li>
            <li>For an iced version, prepare the coffee as usual, then let it cool down or pour it over ice for a refreshing treat.</li>
            <li>Instant coffee can also be used as an ingredient in baking, smoothies, or even in your favorite coffee-flavored desserts.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For a frothy texture, add a little milk or cream to your mug and froth it using a milk frother before stirring in the coffee. This adds a velvety texture to your instant coffee!</p>
