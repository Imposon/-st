    <h1>Filter Coffee Recipe</h1>
</header>

<div class="content">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons of ground coffee (preferably filter coffee blend, medium grind)</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) of water</li>
        <li>Optional: Milk (dairy or plant-based, to taste)</li>
        <li>Optional: Sugar (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the water to just below boiling point, about 200°F (93°C). It’s important not to use boiling water, as it can extract bitterness from the coffee grounds.</li>
            <li>Place a filter paper in your coffee filter or pour-over setup (like a V60 or Chemex). If you’re using a metal filter (such as a South Indian filter), no paper filter is needed.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of ground coffee to the filter. Make sure the coffee is evenly distributed for a uniform extraction.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the hot water over the coffee grounds in a circular motion. Pour in small increments, allowing the water to soak and drip through. The total brewing time should be around 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the water has dripped through the filter and the coffee has brewed, remove the filter. Your fresh filter coffee is now ready!</li>
            <li>If you prefer your coffee black, pour it into a cup and enjoy as is. Otherwise, add milk and sugar to taste.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use freshly ground coffee for the best flavor. The grind should be medium, similar to the grind used for drip coffee.</li>
            <li>If you don’t have a coffee filter, you can use a fine mesh strainer or make a DIY filter with a clean cloth, though a dedicated filter is preferred for best results.</li>
            <li>To achieve a stronger cup of coffee, use more ground coffee (about 1 tablespoon more per cup) or reduce the amount of water.</li>
            <li>If you're preparing coffee for a group, you can brew several cups in a large drip coffee maker or use a traditional South Indian coffee filter.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For extra smoothness and flavor, try brewing your filter coffee in a South Indian coffee filter. The coffee drips through slowly, resulting in a rich, full-bodied cup of coffee.</p>
