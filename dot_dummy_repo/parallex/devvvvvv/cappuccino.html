<div class="content">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 shot of espresso (18-20 grams of coffee)</li>
        <li>120 ml (about 4 oz) of fresh whole milk</li>
        <li>Optional: Sweetener (sugar, cinnamon, or flavored syrups)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind the coffee beans finely and brew a shot of espresso (about 30 ml).</li>
            <li>Steam the milk using a steam wand until it reaches 65-70째C (149-158째F), creating a velvety texture with a thick foam.</li>
            <li>Pour the shot of espresso into a warm cup.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the steamed milk into the espresso, aiming for a ratio of about 1:1:1 (one part espresso, one part steamed milk, one part foam).</li>
            <li>Spoon the foam on top to form a thick, frothy cap over the espresso.</li>
            <li>Optional: Add sweetener (sugar, cinnamon, or syrups) to taste, and stir gently.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For the perfect foam, use whole milk or a high-fat milk alternative, like oat milk.</li>
            <li>Ensure your milk is steamed to the right temperature (65-70째C or 149-158째F). Too hot, and it can taste burnt; too cold, and it won't foam well.</li>
            <li>If you want to make a stronger cappuccino, you can add a double shot of espresso.</li>
            <li>Experiment with adding a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top of the foam for added flavor.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> To create a beautiful cappuccino with perfect foam, practice pouring the milk slowly into the espresso and finish with a spoonful of foam on top. The foam should be thick enough to hold its shape.</p>
