    <h1>Black Coffee Recipe</h1>
</header>

<div class="content">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of freshly ground coffee (or 1 coffee pod for single-serve machines)</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) of water</li>
        <li>Optional: Ice (for iced black coffee)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure out 1-2 tablespoons of freshly ground coffee. Use a medium to coarse grind, depending on your brewing method. For a stronger coffee, you can use more coffee grounds.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 cup (240 ml) of water. The ideal temperature for brewing black coffee is between 195°F (90°C) and 205°F (96°C), just below boiling.</li>
            <li>Brewing methods can vary, so choose one based on your preference:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drip coffee maker:</strong> Add the coffee grounds to the filter and pour hot water over the grounds.</li>
                    <li><strong>French press:</strong> Add the coffee grounds to the press, pour hot water over the grounds, stir, place the lid on, and let steep for 4 minutes before pressing the plunger.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pour-over:</strong> Place the coffee grounds in a filter, then slowly pour the hot water over the grounds in a circular motion, allowing the coffee to drip through.</li>
                    <li><strong>Espresso machine:</strong> Add the coffee grounds to the portafilter, tamp them down, and pull a shot of espresso.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once brewed, serve immediately. If you prefer your coffee black, do not add milk or cream.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> If you like iced black coffee, pour the brewed coffee over ice in a glass. You can chill the coffee beforehand for a smoother experience.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use freshly ground coffee beans for the best flavor. The grind size should match your brewing method (coarser for French press, medium for drip coffee, fine for espresso).</li>
            <li>If you prefer a smoother cup, try using filtered water to brew your coffee.</li>
            <li>If the coffee tastes too bitter, experiment with reducing the brewing time or adjusting the coffee-to-water ratio to suit your taste.</li>
            <li>For iced black coffee, brew the coffee in advance and refrigerate it, or pour it over ice immediately after brewing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you find black coffee too strong, try adding a pinch of salt to the coffee grounds before brewing. It can help reduce bitterness and enhance the coffee’s natural flavors.</p>
