    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons of finely ground Turkish coffee (per serving)</li>
        <li>1 cup (120 ml) of cold water (per serving)</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by measuring your water. For each cup of Turkish coffee, use one small coffee cup of cold water (around 120 ml).</li>
            <li>Pour the cold water into a **cezve** (a small, long-handled pot traditionally used for making Turkish coffee). This is the key vessel used to prepare Turkish coffee.</li>
            <li>Add 1-2 teaspoons of finely ground Turkish coffee to the water (depending on how strong you want your coffee).</li>
            <li>If you prefer sweetened coffee, add sugar at this stage. Turkish coffee can be made in three levels of sweetness:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sade (unsweetened) – no sugar</li>
                    <li>Az şekerli (lightly sweet) – 1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
                    <li>Orta (medium sweet) – 2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
                    <li>Şekerli (sweet) – 3 teaspoons of sugar</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you like, add a pinch of ground cardamom or other spices for extra flavor. This is an optional addition, but it's common in some variations of Turkish coffee.</li>
            <li>Place the cezve over low heat. Slowly heat the mixture, stirring gently until the coffee and sugar (if used) dissolve. Do not stir once it starts heating up.</li>
            <li>As the coffee heats, foam will begin to form on top. Just before it begins to boil, remove the cezve from the heat. Let the foam settle for a few seconds, then return it to the heat.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process 2-3 times to build the foam. The more foam, the better!</li>
            <li>Once the coffee is ready, pour it carefully into small coffee cups, making sure to distribute the foam evenly.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your rich, aromatic Turkish coffee!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For the best flavor, always use freshly ground Turkish coffee, as it has a much finer grind than regular coffee.</li>
            <li>When making Turkish coffee, it’s important to heat it slowly. Never let the coffee come to a rapid boil, as this can cause it to lose its flavor and become bitter.</li>
            <li>Turkish coffee is traditionally served with a glass of water on the side to cleanse the palate before drinking the coffee.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Turkish coffee is traditionally served without milk or cream, and it is enjoyed slowly. To enhance the experience, pair it with a piece of Turkish delight or a small sweet treat!</p>
