<div class="content">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot water</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) of cold milk (dairy or plant-based)</li>
        <li>Ice cubes (optional, for iced version)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the instant coffee, sugar, and hot water.</li>
            <li>Using a hand whisk, hand mixer, or stand mixer, whisk the mixture vigorously for 2-3 minutes until it becomes thick and frothy. The consistency should be light and creamy.</li>
            <li>Fill a glass with cold milk. If you like, you can add ice cubes for a refreshing iced version.</li>
            <li>Spoon the whipped coffee mixture on top of the milk. The frothy coffee should float on top of the milk.</li>
            <li>Stir the whipped coffee into the milk before drinking, or enjoy it as is with the frothy top.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your creamy, frothy Dalgona coffee!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you donâ€™t have a mixer, you can whisk by hand, but it will take longer to achieve the thick, frothy consistency.</li>
            <li>For a sweeter Dalgona coffee, add more sugar, or experiment with flavored syrups (e.g., vanilla, caramel).</li>
            <li>If you want a stronger coffee flavor, you can increase the amount of instant coffee in the whipped mixture.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For an extra creamy texture, use full-fat milk or a rich milk alternative like coconut milk, which will make the drink more velvety.</p>
