        <li>1 shot (45 ml) of Irish whiskey</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brew a cup of strong, hot coffee. It’s important to use freshly brewed coffee for the best flavor.</li>
            <li>While the coffee is brewing, pre-warm your mug by filling it with hot water and letting it sit for a minute or so, then discarding the water.</li>
            <li>Add 1-2 teaspoons of brown sugar to the warmed mug, then pour in the hot coffee. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add 1 shot (45 ml) of Irish whiskey to the coffee and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Top the coffee with a generous dollop of fresh whipped cream. The cream should float on top, creating a layered effect.</li>
            <li>Optional: Garnish with a light dusting of cocoa powder or a few coffee beans on top of the whipped cream for a nice presentation.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your Irish Coffee!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For the best taste, use freshly brewed coffee and high-quality Irish whiskey such as Jameson or Bushmills.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the sweetness by adding more or less brown sugar, or even using a flavored syrup if you prefer.</li>
            <li>If you don’t have fresh whipped cream, you can use store-bought whipped cream, but fresh cream will give the drink a richer texture.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When making the whipped cream, use heavy cream and whisk it until soft peaks form. Don’t over-whip, as it can turn into butter.</p>
