<div class="content">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>18-20 grams of finely ground espresso coffee</li>
        <li>30 ml (1 ounce) of hot water</li>
        <li>Optional: Sweetener (sugar or syrup) to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind your coffee beans finely, similar to the grind you would use for a regular espresso.</li>
            <li>Set up your espresso machine with a portafilter and tamp the ground coffee evenly into the basket. Make sure the coffee is packed tightly.</li>
            <li>Pull a shot of espresso with a shorter extraction time (around 20-25 seconds). This will produce a ristretto, which is a more concentrated shot of espresso.</li>
            <li>The result should be about 30 ml (1 ounce) of coffee, which is less than the usual 60 ml (2 ounces) for a standard espresso shot, but with a more intense, richer flavor.</li>
            <li>If desired, you can add a small amount of sweetener to balance the bitterness, though many enjoy ristretto in its pure form.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately in a small espresso cup and enjoy the concentrated, bold flavor of the ristretto!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Since ristretto is a shorter extraction, itâ€™s more concentrated than a regular espresso and has a fuller, richer flavor with a slightly sweeter profile.</li>
            <li>If you like your ristretto less intense, you can experiment with adjusting the amount of water or using a slightly coarser grind.</li>
            <li>If you're using a manual espresso machine or a stovetop espresso maker, the same principle applies: reduce the water used and extract a smaller, more concentrated shot.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ristretto is perfect for those who enjoy a stronger, bolder coffee flavor but without the bitterness that can sometimes come from a regular espresso shot. It's also a great base for other drinks like lattes or cappuccinos when you want a more intense flavor.</p>
