    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brew a cup of coffee, making it a bit stronger than usual for better flavor when served iced.</li>
            <li>Allow the coffee to cool down to room temperature, or chill it in the refrigerator for faster cooling. (Alternatively, you can brew the coffee ahead of time and refrigerate it.)</li>
            <li>Fill a glass with ice cubes.</li>
            <li>Pour the cooled coffee over the ice cubes, leaving some space at the top of the glass.</li>
            <li>Add milk or cream to taste. For a creamier drink, you can use whole milk or a milk alternative like oat milk or almond milk.</li>
            <li>Sweeten to your liking with sugar, simple syrup, or flavored syrups like vanilla or caramel. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Optional: Top with whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat!</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your refreshing iced coffee!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For an even colder coffee, you can freeze coffee ice cubes (made from leftover coffee) and use them in place of regular ice cubes. This prevents the coffee from getting watered down.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a sweeter iced coffee, use simple syrup since it dissolves more easily in cold liquids than regular sugar.</li>
            <li>To add more flavor, you can experiment with flavored syrups like vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut. Or, try adding a pinch of cinnamon or cocoa powder for a different twist.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're in a hurry and donâ€™t want to wait for the coffee to cool down, brew a strong cup of coffee and pour it into an ice cube tray. Once frozen, pop the cubes into your glass for instant iced coffee without watering it down!</p>
